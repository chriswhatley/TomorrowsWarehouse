Logistex’s LWS Reflex Warehouse Management System is a flexible, scalable solution for all warehouse operations from simple manual through to complex automation. Unlike many other systems LWS Reflex is not licensed per user but licensed by site with unlimited users, so there’s no financial penalty for growth.  LWS Reflex means never having to buy another WMS, ever.

Our customer service division comprises over 150 staff working either as part of residential support teams on customer sites, field service engineers, or technical support in house in our Kettering offices. Logistex can provide engineering support services to any warehouse from ad-hoc maintenance through to full facilities management. The hotline support service is available 24/7 to ensure that all our customers receive the very best service and rapid response.
