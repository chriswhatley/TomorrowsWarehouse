Since its establishment in 1969, TGW Logistics Group has evolved from a small fitter's shop into a leading international system integrator. 

For the customers in our core industries of Fashion & Apparel, Grocery and Industrial & Consumer Goods, TGW plans and implements highly automated, efficient and future-proof fulfilment centres around the world, solving customer’s supply chain challenges along the way. To do so, TGW builds on strong partnerships at every stage, from planning to implementation to Lifetime Services.

In January 2007, TGW opened a brand new entity in Market Harborough, located in the centre of the UK. TGW Limited started the business with a small team of five people. Due to rapid growth, it soon became necessary to find larger premises.  In 2014 TGW Limited moved to a ‘custom-designed’ building called Falcon Court. The front of the building includes a fully operational Mustang Evolution mini-load that not only enhances the visitor experience but is used to store site and safety equipment for engineers. In 2016, TGW Limited acquired a second building (Hawk House) a mere stone's throw from Falcon Court.
 
In addition to experienced Sales & Realisation teams, TGW Limited also has a strong Lifetime Service team. This team of engineers and technicians are available 24/7 to provide customers with the necessary support when and where needed, via a hotline service or local intervention. TGW Limited also boasts a significant number of on-site, residential engineers. The ambitions remain high as TGW Limited strives to continue to grow for many more years to come. Now part of the Northern European HUB together with TGW Systems BV in the Benelux, TGW Scandinavia AB in Sweden and TGW Limited in Lithuania, the workforce totals approximately 440.
