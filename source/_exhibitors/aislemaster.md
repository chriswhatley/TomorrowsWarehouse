**The versatile articulated truck that does it all**

Aisle Master is the world’s largest selling articulated forklift – and with good reason. These  versatile,  tough and extremely reliable trucks replace a combination of reach and counterbalance forklifts and can potentially double storage capacity for substantial cost savings. By using just the one truck, productivity can also be increased as time consuming double handling is eliminated for faster “truck to rack” operations. There is also no need to invest in super flat floors in the warehouse, unlike operation with other traditional types of VNA trucks.

- Work in aisles as narrow as 1.6m
- AC electric, diesel or LPG powered models with lift capacities of up to 3t and impressive lift heights of up to 15m.
- Developed, designed and manufactures at the new production facility of parent company Combilift in Monaghan, Ireland.
- Superb in-cab ergonomics for driver comfort, safety and visibility

A cold store version is also available, developed specifically for this sector’s exacting requirements. This won the UK FLTA award for innovation and its advantages were summed up as follows: “When space comes at a premium, flexible solutions are needed. Combining the capabilities of a narrow aisle fork lift with the protection offered by a fully enclosed cold store cab, the articulated Aisle Master cold store model ensures maximum efficiency – even at minus thirty degrees.”

An in-house team of design engineers works with customers to produce warehouse layout designs, material flow calculations and 3D simulations, free of charge, which provide a unique view of the space saving benefits of the Aisle Master products.
