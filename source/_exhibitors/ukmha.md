The UKMHA is a not-for-profit organisation representing all aspects of the UK's material handling industry, including manufacturers, suppliers, dealers and other stakeholders. The new association has been formed by the merger of the industry’s two most respected trade associations – the British Industrial Truck Association (BITA) and the Fork Lift Truck Association (FLTA).

Harnessing the expertise from both organisations, the UKMHA will play a vital role as the single voice of the material handling industry, dedicated to creating an environment where all its members can prosper, and technical excellence is paramount.

Promoting improved safety standards industry-wide is a main priority, aided by existing campaigns including National Forklift Safety Day, the Forklift Safety Convention and Safety Drive. In addition to collating focused market intelligence, which is shared between all members, the association ensures that member needs are considered in key areas of legislation, including on key issues such as safety, trade and training. Representation on UK and European standards committees will ensure the highest standards are consistently maintained.
