With over 25 years of experience, CopriSystems is a market leader in the design, manufacture and installation of warehouse extensions, shelters, canopies, freestanding buildings, bespoke structures and sports domes.

With the price of moving to a new site often prohibitively expensive, CopriSystems allows your company to expand with an affordable solution with many purchasing options, including rental. Our structures can fix directly to existing concrete, preventing additional foundation costs.

With single open spans up to 100 metres and unlimited length, we’re confident we can offer a structure that meets all your business requirements.

Our structures conform to building regulations for wind and snow, whether using galvanised steel, Glulam wood or aluminium with a PVC covering or steel cladding to different specifications.

In offering full turnkey projects, starting with the correct design, through planning (if required) and onto installation including lighting, doors, groundworks and a number of other additions, we endeavour to make the process as pain-free as possible. In doing this, we’re willing to work over weekends and schedule works to suit your business timescales.
