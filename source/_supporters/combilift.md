Combilift is globally acknowledged as one of the most innovative manufacturers of customised material handling solutions for a wide range of industry sectors. Since Combilift was established in 1998 with the launch of the world’s first I.C engine powered, all-wheel drive multi-directional forklift, it has produced over 45,000 units of a wide range of models which have been sold in over 85 countries.

Designed for the safe, space saving and productive handling of long and bulky loads, palletised goods, containers and oversized loads, Combilift’s products are characterised by robust build, long life operation and indoor/outdoor capability to offer the utmost versatility. Combilifts are  developed, designed and manufactured in the company’s new global HQ and facility in Monaghan, Ireland, which was opened in 2018.

**The range includes:**

- 4 –way forklifts with capacities of up to 25 tonnes
- 3 wheeled and 4 wheeled sideloaders
- Pedestrian counterbalance, reach stackers and powered pallet trucks
- 2-way and multidirectional Combi-ST and GT stand-on trucks
- Combi-SC Straddle Carriers for containers and out of gauge loads with lift capacities of up to 100 t

Ongoing and substantial investment in R&D enables new models to be developed and launched on at least a yearly basis and Combilift can react more quickly than any other manufacturer to tailor new machines to the exact and prevailing demands of the market. Customer feedback has been pivotal for new product development and production lines are configured to offer a very high degree of customisation. Standard and readily available components are used to enable products to be easily maintained and serviced wherever in the world they are being used.
